  <b>TL;DR: We built dRAG, a decentralized RAG system that addresses data reliability challenges in real-world settings </b><br>
</p>

## ⚙️ System Overview
Our dRAG system can be abstracted into three components: *Decentralized Data Sources*, *LLM Service*, and *Decentralized Blockchain Network*. Details can be found in Section 5 of the paper.

## 🚀 How to Deploy dRAG?
We provide detailed instructions for starting the [retrieval service](drag_data_source/README.md), [LLM service](drag_llm_service/README.md), and interacting with the [smart contract](drag_python_client/README.md). For your convenience, we also provide a one-line command to launch the entire dRAG system.

### Quick Start (One-Line Command)
To start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will:
1. Start the contract service (a smart contract deployed on local Hardhat node for testing)
2. Start all three data sources simultaneously (data-source-0, data-source-20, data-source-100, each is assigned with a testing private key provided by Hardhat)
3. Start the LLM service after all data sources are healthy. The LLM service will also have a private key.

To view logs:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

To stop all services:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Testing the System
Once all Docker containers are up and running, you can use the `test.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to interact with the system. The notebook contains:
- Health check tests for all services
- Example queries to test the RAG system
- Integration tests to verify the end-to-end functionality
or check Reliable-dRAG-anonymous/drag_llm_service/README.md for endpoint description.

To use the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook test.ipynb
```

Make sure all services are healthy before running the tests. You can check the service status with:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

If you wish to test the system with publicly smart contract, there is an example deployment on Sepolia (a public Ethereum testnet) at [0x5F67901BC1A22010BA438EDa426A70d0B5eA17Be](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x5F67901BC1A22010BA438EDa426A70d0B5eA17Be). A private key of Sepolia wallet and Infura api key are needed to connect to the testnet.

### Example Visualization
The dRAG system provides real-time monitoring of source scores (usefulness and reliability) over queries.

The visualization demonstrates how the system learns and adapts to source quality over time, with sources showing different performance characteristics based on their pollution levels and content quality.
